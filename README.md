# SDEV140FinalProject2022

"This is my final project for my SDEV140 class at Ivy Tech.
I wanted to make an ore calculator for the video game Stardew Valley since
there aren't any that show the value of items in game until you sell at the end of each day.
I would like to eventually finish the project entirely, covering other parts of the game
and possibly even export as an application for free download. It's pretty airtight,
but if you find any problems please dm me on twitter @brunnerwe. Thanks.
