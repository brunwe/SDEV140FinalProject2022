yo, will here. If windows deems this a trojan, don't worry about it- I don't have any reason to steal your data. If you want, feel free to unpack it and look through the code. I put my name on this though so I'd be shooting myself in the foot if I turned this mf into a virus. Anyways, I hope you enjoy and get some use out of this program. If you find any problems dm me on twitter @brunnerwe. Thanks!
